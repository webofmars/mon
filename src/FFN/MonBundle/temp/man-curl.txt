According to : http://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html

The variables available are:

content_type : The Content-Type of the requested document, if there was any.
filename_effective : The ultimate filename that curl writes out to. This is only meaningful if curl is told to write to a file with the --remote-name or --output option. It's most useful in combination with the --remote-header-name option. (Added in 7.25.1)
ftp_entry_path : The initial path curl ended up in when logging on to the remote FTP server. (Added in 7.15.4)
http_code : The numerical response code that was found in the last retrieved HTTP(S) or FTP(s) transfer. In 7.18.2 the alias response_code was added to show the same info.
http_connect : The numerical code that was found in the last response (from a proxy) to a curl CONNECT request. (Added in 7.12.4)
num_connects : Number of new connects made in the recent transfer. (Added in 7.12.3)
num_redirects : Number of redirects that were followed in the request. (Added in 7.12.3)
redirect_url : When an HTTP request was made without -L to follow redirects, this variable will show the actual URL a redirect would take you to. (Added in 7.18.2)
size_download : The total amount of bytes that were downloaded.
size_header : The total amount of bytes of the downloaded headers.
size_request : The total amount of bytes that were sent in the HTTP request.
size_upload : The total amount of bytes that were uploaded.
speed_download : The average download speed that curl measured for the complete download. Bytes per second.
speed_upload : The average upload speed that curl measured for the complete upload. Bytes per second.
ssl_verify_result : The result of the SSL peer certificate verification that was requested. 0 means the verification was successful. (Added in 7.19.0)
time_appconnect : The time, in seconds, it took from the start until the SSL/SSH/etc connect/handshake to the remote host was completed. (Added in 7.19.0)
time_connect : The time, in seconds, it took from the start until the TCP connect to the remote host (or proxy) was completed.
time_namelookup : The time, in seconds, it took from the start until the name resolving was completed.
time_pretransfer : The time, in seconds, it took from the start until the file transfer was just about to begin. This includes all pre-transfer commands and negotiations that are specific to the particular protocol(s) involved.
time_redirect : The time, in seconds, it took for all redirection steps include name lookup, connect, pretransfer and transfer before the final transaction was started. time_redirect shows the complete execution time for multiple redirections. (Added in 7.12.3)
time_starttransfer : The time, in seconds, it took from the start until the first byte was just about to be transferred. This includes time_pretransfer and also the time the server needed to calculate the result.
time_total : The total time, in seconds, that the full operation lasted. The time will be displayed with millisecond resolution.
url_effective : The URL that was fetched last. This is most meaningful if you've told curl to follow location: headers.

donc les infos interessantes sont : 
+ time_connect
+ time_namelookup
- time_redirect
- time_pretransfer
+ time_starttransfer
+ time_total

En php on retrouve toutes ces infos via des contantes de curl_getinfo : 
CURLINFO_TOTAL_TIME : durée de la transaction en secondes pour le dernier transfert
CURLINFO_NAMELOOKUP_TIME : durée de résolution du nom de domaine en secondes
CURLINFO_CONNECT_TIME : durée d'établissement de la connexion en secondes
CURLINFO_PRETRANSFER_TIME : durée en secondes, entre le début de la transaction et de début du transfert de fichiers
CURLINFO_STARTTRANSFER_TIME : durée en secondes jusqu'à ce que le premier octet soit sur le point d'être transféré
CURLINFO_REDIRECT_TIME : durée en secondes de toutes les étapes de redirection avant que la transaction finale ne soit débutée
